# Robotics-Algorithm

Utilized the RANSAC algorithm to interpret data from the laser range finder, effectively identifying and visualizing the robot's environmental obstacles in rviz.
Programmed the robot to navigate from (-8.0, -2.0) to its designated target at (4.5, 9.0).
Implemented the Bug2 algorithm in ROS, enabling the robot to adeptly avoid obstacles by leveraging lines identified through the RANSAC algorithm.
